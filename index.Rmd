## Project thoughts

I am interested in pursuing data related to African American (descendants of slaves) students in higher education institutions based on their high school (ie. public and private schools). I am intrigued based on the low representation from the Black demographic at institutions, especially Ivy Leagues like Harvard. Unfortunately, Harvard and a lot of institutions don't really collect that data of the ethnicity of Black students which is why I would like to come in and do the research needed to validate why we need to foster a sense of belonging for prospective and current students, bring more resources into schools who lack college prepatory and academic toolkits, and encourage African American students to apply.
